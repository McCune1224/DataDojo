## Overview

Welcome to the documentation page for Restful API Data Dojo, a tool for fetching fighting game information such as game details, character details, and move frame data.

The Data Dojo Web API is a restful API with different available endpoints that will return JSON metadata about general fighting game info, characters, and moves.

## Getting Started

The API is available to all and no API key is required (currently). In order to keep request traffic at a manageable state, a rate-limiter is used.

Detailed documentation is offered for all of our API endpoints, including examples of how to make requests and what data you can expect to receive in response. Check out `References` for further details on what endpoints are available.

## API References

Data Dojo offers the current functionalities:

- Retrieve metadata about your favorite modern fighting game.
- Retrieve metadata about characters.
- Retrieve metadata about a character's frame data.
